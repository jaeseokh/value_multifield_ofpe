# Bayesian Method {-}

The Bayesian method operationalizes the conceptual framework by specifying how prior information, OFPE data, and probabilistic updating are combined into a predictive distribution for yields at each nitrogen rate. Let $N$ denote the nitrogen rate and $Y(N)$ the corresponding random yield. Prior information comes from APSIM simulations and regional yield histories, both of which help characterize long-run agronomic outcomes under alternative nitrogen regimes @holzworth2014apsim; @naderi2020yieldtrends. This information is summarized through the first three moments,
$$
\mu_{1,0}(N), \qquad \mu_{2,0}(N), \qquad \mu_{3,0}(N),
$$
representing the prior mean, variance, and third central moment. These moments define the prior density $f_0(y \mid N)$, which provides an informative but imperfect representation of field-level yield behavior.

To incorporate field evidence, the OFPE design assigns multiple subplots to each nitrogen rate @bullock2019ofpe; @mieno2022learning. Suppose that rate $N_k$ is applied to $n_k$ subplots with yields $\{Y_{k1},\dots,Y_{k n_k}\}$. The sample mean,
$$
\bar{Y}_k = \frac{1}{n_k}\sum_j Y_{kj},
$$
is treated as a noisy measurement of the underlying field-specific mean yield $\mu_1(N_k)$. Under standard sampling assumptions for subplot-scale agronomic experiments @casella2002statistical, the corresponding likelihood is
$$
\bar{Y}_k \mid \mu_1(N_k)
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(\mu_1(N_k),\,\frac{\sigma^2(N_k)}{n_k}\right),
$$
which reflects the high precision of subplot means within a year but only for the weather state realized during the trial.

The prior distribution for $\mu_1(N)$ is specified as
$$
\mu_1(N) \sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(m_0(N),\,v_0(N)\right),
$$
where $m_0(N)$ equals the APSIM-derived prior mean $\mu_{1,0}(N)$ and $v_0(N)$ formalizes uncertainty about how well APSIM approximates field conditions. The Normal–Normal conjugacy @gelman2013bayesian yields the posterior distribution
$$
\mu_1(N) \mid \bar{Y}(N)
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(m_1(N),\,v_1(N)\right),
$$
with posterior variance
$$
v_1(N)
=
\left[
\frac{1}{v_0(N)} + \frac{n(N)}{\sigma^2(N)}
\right]^{-1},
$$
and posterior mean
$$
m_1(N)
=
v_1(N)\left[
\frac{m_0(N)}{v_0(N)} +
\frac{n(N)\bar{Y}(N)}{\sigma^2(N)}
\right].
$$

These expressions formalize the central mechanism of Bayesian updating: information from APSIM simulations is combined with field observations in proportion to their respective precisions. When $n(N)$ is large, the OFPE mean has greater influence; when the prior variance $v_0(N)$ is small, the posterior remains closer to the simulation-informed expectation. The posterior variance decreases as either the OFPE sample size grows or the prior becomes more informative.

To obtain a predictive distribution for yields, both uncertainty in the long-run mean and within-season stochastic variation must be incorporated. Conceptually, the posterior predictive density is
$$
f_{\text{post}}(y \mid N)
=
\int f(y \mid \mu_1(N))\,
p(\mu_1(N) \mid \text{data})\,
d\mu_1(N),
$$
a mixture reflecting uncertainty about the underlying mean combined with yield variability conditional on that mean @gelman2013bayesian. Because higher-order moments of the posterior cannot be inferred reliably from one or two OFPE years, the predictive density is represented via a maximum-entropy distribution matching the posterior mean, posterior variance, and prior-informed third moment @jaynes1957information1; @jaynes1957information2. This construction preserves essential moment information while remaining agnostic about unsupported distributional features.

The resulting predictive distribution enters the farmer’s economic decision problem:
$$
N_{\text{post}}^\star
=
\arg\max_N
\Big\{
p_y\,\mathbb{E}_{\text{post}}[Y(N)] - p_n\,N
\Big\},
$$
where $\mathbb{E}_{\text{post}}[Y(N)]$ is evaluated under $f_{\text{post}}(y \mid N)$ @antle1983stochastic; @just1990studies. The Bayesian method thus generates a nitrogen recommendation that reflects both agronomic knowledge encoded in APSIM and the local information obtained from OFPE experiments. As additional OFPE seasons accumulate, the posterior predictive distribution becomes increasingly shaped by field-level observations, and the decision rule progressively converges toward the field’s long-run optimum. In this way, the Bayesian method provides a coherent mechanism for integrating heterogeneous information sources into a unified and continuously improving decision-support system.
