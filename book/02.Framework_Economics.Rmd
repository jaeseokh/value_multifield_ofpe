# Economic Framework {-}

On-farm experiments (OFEs) have long been a cornerstone of agronomic research, providing structured, randomized trials to estimate crop yield responses to key inputs such as nitrogen (N). Their small plot size, however, limits the ability to capture spatial heterogeneity, which can bias estimates of the Economic Optimum Nitrogen Rate (EONR) when field variability is ignored @bullock2009value; @anselin2004spatial. The emergence of On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPEs) offers a scalable alternative. Using GPS-guided machinery, OFPEs introduce variable-rate nitrogen treatments across entire commercial fields, generating large spatial datasets that better reflect realistic production environments @bullock2019data; @gebbers2010precision. This approach introduces new costs and risks for growers, because testing extreme nitrogen rates—particularly low or unprofitable levels—can expose farmers to revenue losses @de2023predicting, and multi-year replication is often required to capture the agronomic interactions between nitrogen, soil, and weather.

Within this setting, the central question is whether multi-field OFPE data can provide decision-relevant information for fields where no direct OFPE has been conducted. If the answer is positive, OFPE data generate positive informational externalities, enabling farmers to benefit from trials done on other fields. This possibility is especially important in the U.S. Corn Belt, where growers manage large areas but face logistical, financial, and risk-related barriers to running their own OFPEs. The economic framework developed here formalizes this question and provides a basis for evaluating the value of cross-field information.

Following @bullock2009value, crop yield $y$ is modeled as
$$
y = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{z}),
$$
where $\mathbf{x}$ denotes a vector of controllable inputs such as seed, fertilizer, herbicides, and hybrids; $\mathbf{c}$ collects field characteristics such as soil, organic matter, and topography; and $\mathbf{z}$ represents stochastic temporal variables such as weather and pest pressure. The full function $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{z})$ is referred to as nature’s meta-response function. For a specific field $i$ with characteristic map $\mathbf{c}_i$, the site-specific response function is
$$
f_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) \equiv f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}_i, \mathbf{z}),
$$
which determines how yield responds to nitrogen under that field’s soil and topographic conditions.

Assuming nitrogen is the only controllable input and prices $\mathbf{p}$ (crop) and $\mathbf{w}$ (N) are fixed, the farmer’s profit is
$$
\pi = \mathbf{p}\, f_i(N, \mathbf{z}) - \mathbf{w}\, N.
$$
Farmers face two conceptually distinct sources of uncertainty when choosing $N$. First, weather events $\mathbf{z} \in Z$ follow a climate distribution $h(\mathbf{z})$, but the realized $\mathbf{z}$ is not known ex ante. Second, farmers are uncertain about the true yield response function. They hold a subjective distribution $g(f_i^m \mid \eta)$ over a finite set of possible response functions
$$
\Omega = \{ f_i^1, \ldots, f_i^M \},
$$
with the true function denoted $f_i^R$. Here $\eta$ represents the available information. As information improves, beliefs become more concentrated, and $g(f_i^m \mid \eta)$ tends toward one for $m=R$, in the sense described by @laffont1989economie.

Expected maximum profit under information set $\eta$ is given by
$$
E(\pi_i \mid \eta)
= 
\max_N
\int_{z \in Z}
\left\{
  \sum_{m=1}^M 
  \left[
    \mathbf{p}\, f_i^m(N,\mathbf{z}) - \mathbf{w}\, N
  \right]
  g(f_i^m \mid \eta)
\right\}
h(\mathbf{z}) \, d\mathbf{z},
$$
which explicitly shows how the quality of information affects the nitrogen decision and the resulting expected profit.

OFPEs provide information about the field-specific structure of $f_i(N,\mathbf{z})$, the interaction between applied nitrogen and soil or topographic features $\mathbf{c}_i$, and the way weather modifies nitrogen response. Given rich OFPE data on field $i$, beliefs over the space of response functions can collapse toward the truth, so that
$$
g(f_i^R \mid \eta^{\prime}) = 1,
$$
where $\eta^{\prime}$ denotes information obtained from a single-field OFPE. However, if single-field OFPEs are infeasible, farmers may rely instead on benchmark information $\eta^{\prime}$ from their own OFPE, when available, or on $\eta^{\prime\prime}$, which summarizes information from multi-field OFPE data. The key welfare comparison is
$$
\left|
\big[E(\pi_i \mid \eta^{\prime\prime}) - E(\pi_i \mid \eta^\prime)\big]
-
\big[C(\eta^{\prime\prime}) - C(\eta^\prime)\big]
\right|,
$$
where $E(\pi_i \mid \eta^\prime)$ is expected profit using field-specific OFPE data, $E(\pi_i \mid \eta^{\prime\prime})$ is expected profit using cross-field information, and $C(\eta)$ denotes the cost of obtaining information set $\eta$. The empirical analysis asks whether $\eta^{\prime\prime}$ can approximate $\eta^\prime$ in terms of decision quality, that is, whether multi-field OFPE data can provide nearly as much decision value as a field’s own OFPE.

To address this question, machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Causal Forest are used to predict the EONR for a given field based on data from other fields. The benchmark EONR, denoted $\text{EONR}_d$, is constructed ex post using generalized additive model (GAM)–based yield–nitrogen curves fitted to each field @wood2017generalized. The cross-field prediction, $\text{EONR}_o$, is obtained from models trained on multi-field OFPE data. Comparisons between $\text{EONR}_o$ and $\text{EONR}_d$ reveal large gaps, a lack of convergence across machine-learning methods, instability in predictions across price and weather regimes, and biological implausibility in some of the yield–nitrogen curves implied by cross-field predictions. These failures arise from the limited number of OFPE trials, which restricts weather and spatial diversity; from the static, low-resolution nature of soil and topographic covariates such as SSURGO and DEM; and from complex interactions among nitrogen, water, mineralization, and weather that are difficult for purely statistical models to capture.

The economic implication is that current multi-field OFPE data, when used with flexible machine-learning methods alone, are not yet a reliable substitute for a field’s own experiment. The framework developed here therefore motivates a transition to a Bayesian–APSIM approach, in which mechanistic crop models and regional yield histories are used to construct priors that can be coherently updated with OFPE data, offering a more robust basis for nitrogen decision support under uncertainty.
