## 1. Motivation and Role of Information {-}

On-farm experiments (OFEs) have long been a cornerstone of agronomic research, providing structured, randomized trials to estimate crop yield responses to key inputs such as nitrogen (N). Their small plot size, however, limits the ability to capture spatial heterogeneity, which can bias estimates of the Economic Optimum Nitrogen Rate (EONR) when field variability is ignored [@bullock2009value; @anselin2004spatial].

The emergence of On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPEs) offers a scalable alternative. Using GPS-guided machinery, OFPEs introduce variable-rate nitrogen treatments across entire commercial fields, generating large spatial datasets that better reflect realistic production environments [@bullock2019data; @gebbers2010precision]. Yet, this approach introduces new costs and risks for growers. Testing extreme N rates—particularly low or unprofitable levels—can expose farmers to revenue losses [@de2023predicting], and multi-year replication is often required to capture the agronomic interactions between nitrogen, soil, and weather.

These constraints raise the central question of this study:

**Can multi-field OFPE data provide decision-relevant information for fields where no direct OFPE has been conducted?**

If so, OFPE data could generate **positive externalities**, enabling farmers to benefit from trials done on other fields. This would be especially valuable in the U.S. Corn Belt, where growers manage large areas but face logistical, financial, and risk-related barriers to running their own OFPEs.

This chapter develops the economic framework underlying that question.

## 2. Yield Response and the Information Structure {-}

Following @bullock2009value, crop yield $y$ is modeled as:

$$
y = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{z})
$$ {#eq-yield}

where:

- $\mathbf{x}$ = vector of controllable inputs (seed, fertilizer, herbicides, hybrids),  
- $\mathbf{c}$ = field characteristics (soil, organic matter, topography),  
- $\mathbf{z}$ = stochastic temporal variables (weather, pests).

The full function  
$$f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{z})$$  
is referred to as **nature’s meta-response function**.

For a specific field $i$ with characteristic map $\mathbf{c}_i$, the site-specific response function is:

$$
f_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) \equiv f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}_i, \mathbf{z})
$$

This function determines how yield responds to nitrogen under that field’s soil and topographic conditions.

## 3. Farmer’s Profit Maximization Problem {-}

Assuming nitrogen is the only controllable input and prices $\mathbf{p}$ (crop) and $\mathbf{w}$ (N) are fixed, the farmer’s profit is:

$$
\pi = \mathbf{p}\, f_i(N, \mathbf{z}) - \mathbf{w}\, N
$$ {#eq-profit}

Farmers face **two sources of uncertainty** when choosing $N$:

1. **Weather uncertainty.**  
   Weather events $\mathbf{z} \in Z$ follow a known climate distribution $h(\mathbf{z})$, but farmers cannot know the realized $\mathbf{z}$ ex ante.

2. **Uncertainty about the true yield response function.**  
   Farmers have a subjective distribution $g(f_i^m \mid \eta)$ over the set of possible yield response functions  
   $$\Omega = \{ f_i^1, \ldots, f_i^M \}$$  
   where the true function is $f_i^R$.

More information (denoted $\eta$) sharpens this belief, causing  
$$g(f_i^m \mid \eta) \to 1 \text{ for } m = R$$  
as in @laffont1989economie.

Thus, expected maximum profit under information $\eta$ is:

$$
E(\pi_i \mid \eta)
= 
\max_N
\int_{z \in Z}
\left\{
  \sum_{m=1}^M 
  \left[
    \mathbf{p}\, f_i^m(N,\mathbf{z}) - \mathbf{w}\, N
  \right]
  g(f_i^m \mid \eta)
\right\}
h(\mathbf{z}) \, d\mathbf{z}
$$ {#eq-expected-profit}

This expression is central: it shows **how better information leads to better nitrogen decisions**.

## 4. How OFPE Data Provide Information {-}

OFPEs reveal information about:

- the field-specific structure of $f_i(N,\mathbf{z})$,  
- the interaction between applied N and soil/topographic features $\mathbf{c}_i$,  
- the way weather modifies nitrogen response.

Given OFPE data, beliefs collapse:

$$
g(f_i^R \mid \eta^{\prime}) = 1
$$

where $\eta^\prime$ denotes information from a *single-field* OFPE.

However, if single-field OFPEs are infeasible, farmers may rely on:

- $\eta^{\prime}$ = benchmark information (from own OFPE),  
- $\eta^{\prime\prime}$ = **information from multi-field OFPE data**.

The relevant welfare comparison is:

$$
\left|
\big[E(\pi_i \mid \eta^{\prime\prime}) - E(\pi_i \mid \eta^\prime)\big]
-
\big[C(\eta^{\prime\prime}) - C(\eta^\prime)\big]
\right|
$$ {#eq-welfare}

Here:

- $E(\pi_i \mid \eta^\prime)$ = expected profit using field-specific OFPE data  
- $E(\pi_i \mid \eta^{\prime\prime})$ = expected profit using cross-field information  
- $C(\eta)$ = cost of obtaining information set $\eta$

This study evaluates whether $\eta^{\prime\prime}$ can approximate $\eta^\prime$ —  
**i.e., whether multi-field OFPE data can provide nearly as much decision value as a field’s own OFPE.**

## 5. Why Multi-Field OFPE Predictions Fail (Link to ML Results) {-}

Using machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Causal Forest), we evaluate whether EONR predictions from other fields (EONR\_o) approximate the benchmark EONR from the field’s own OFPE (EONR\_d).  
EONR\_d is constructed ex post using GAM-based yield–N curves fitted to each field [@wood2017generalized].

Results reveal:

- **Large gaps** between EONR\_o and EONR\_d  
- **No convergence** across ML methods  
- **Instability** in predictions across price and weather regimes  
- **Biological implausibility** in yield–N curves derived from cross-field predictions  

These inconsistencies stem from:

1. **Limited number of OFPE trials** → insufficient weather and spatial diversity  
2. **Static, low-resolution soil/topographic covariates** (SSURGO, DEM)  
3. **Complex interactions** between N, water, mineralization, and weather  
4. **Mismatch between machine-learning predictors and underlying agronomic processes**

Thus, current multi-field OFPE data are **not yet a reliable substitute** for a field’s own experiment.

# Summary {-}

This chapter presents the economic logic guiding the analysis:

- Farmers maximize expected profit under uncertainty about weather and the yield response function.  
- OFPEs provide information that sharpens beliefs about the true response function.  
- Multi-field OFPE data may or may not provide information comparable to single-field OFPE data.  
- The welfare value of cross-field information depends on how well EONR\_o approximates EONR\_d.  
- Empirical evidence (Chapter: Results Limitations) shows major failures in generalization, motivating the transition to a **Bayesian–APSIM** framework.

The next chapter introduces the mechanistic, simulation-based priors that overcome many of the limitations identified above.
