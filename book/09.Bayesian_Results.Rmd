# 1. Overview {-}

This chapter presents the empirical results of the Bayesian moment–based updating framework developed in the previous sections. Using:

- **APSIM mechanistic priors**,  
- **OFPE field-level sample moments**, and  
- **Bayesian posterior updates**,  

we quantify how trial data refine beliefs about field-specific nitrogen response and evaluate the implications for nitrogen recommendations and economic outcomes.

The results show:

1. **APSIM provides stable structural priors**, but is not field-specific.  
2. **OFPE provides field-specific but noisy evidence**, often too weak to determine an economic optimum alone.  
3. **The posterior appropriately balances the two**, producing smoother, more stable, and more economically coherent nitrogen-rate recommendations.

# 2. How OFPE Updates APSIM Priors at the Moment Level {-}

The Bayesian update yields posterior moments:

- posterior mean: $\mu_{1,\text{post}}(N)$  
- posterior variance: $\mu_{2,\text{post}}(N)$  
- posterior third moment: $\mu_{3,\text{post}}(N)$ (from APSIM)

These combine into a posterior predictive distribution for yield at every nitrogen rate.

### **Key empirical findings**

Across Illinois field-years:

- **Posterior means move toward OFPE when cluster sample sizes are large**  
  and the OFPE curve is locally consistent.

- **Posterior means remain close to APSIM when OFPE is noisy**,  
  especially in low-replication clusters and noisy parts of the field.

- **Posterior variances shrink substantially**,  
  reflecting the information gain from combining mechanistic priors with observational data.

This demonstrates a central strength of the Bayesian approach:  
**OFPE influences the posterior only where the data are informative.**

# 3. Posterior Yield–N Curves: Field-Level Examples {-}

Figures produced in this section (saved under  
`book/Results/Figures/stage2_bayes/`) illustrate, for multiple fields:

- **APSIM prior curve**  
- **OFPE sample means**  
- **Posterior mean curve** from Bayesian updating

A typical pattern is:

1. APSIM provides a smooth, concave response curve.  
2. OFPE points fluctuate widely around this structure, reflecting spatial and weather noise.  
3. The posterior curve lies between the two:
   - anchored by APSIM shape,  
   - nudged by field-specific OFPE signal,  
   - avoiding the jaggedness and volatility seen in OFPE-only fits.

This yields a **credible, field-specific yield–N curve** even when OFPE is sparse.

# 4. Optimal Nitrogen Rates Under Prior, OFPE, and Posterior Information {-}

For any distribution $f(y \mid N)$, expected profit is:

$$
E[\pi(N)] = p_y \mu_1(N) - p_n N.
$$

Using this rule, we compute:

- **$N^\star_{\text{prior}}$** — optimal N from APSIM alone  
- **$N^\star_{\text{ofpe}}$** — optimal N from OFPE cluster means alone  
- **$N^\star_{\text{post}}$** — optimal N from the Bayesian posterior

### **Empirical conclusions**

Across Illinois field-years:

1. **$N^\star_{\text{prior}}$ is smooth and stable**, reflecting APSIM’s long-run structure.  
2. **$N^\star_{\text{ofpe}}$ is highly volatile**, sometimes jumping ±40–60 lb/ac across years.  
3. **$N^\star_{\text{post}}$ is consistently intermediate**:
   - closer to APSIM when data are noisy,  
   - more field-specific when OFPE shows strong, well-replicated signals.

Posterior optimal N exhibits **substantial smoothing**, making it more aligned with agronomic expectations and economic reasoning.

# 5. Evaluation on Repeated Fields: What Do Farmers Gain From OFPE? {-}

Many Illinois fields contain **two or more OFPE years**, allowing year‐to‐year comparison.

For each repeated field, we compute:

- profit under APSIM-optimal rate (prior)  
- profit under OFPE-optimal rate (data-only)  
- profit under posterior-optimal rate (Bayesian)  
- profit under the *ex post* best rate (benchmark)

We then compare differences in **profit** and **nitrogen use**.

---

## 5.1 Profit results {-}

Across repeated fields:

- **OFPE-only recommendations frequently underperform**,  
  sometimes generating losses due to overreaction to noisy data.

- **APSIM priors perform reasonably well**,  
  especially in years where weather resembles long-run climate.

- **Posterior decisions perform best overall**,  
  minimizing regret relative to the benchmark.

The posterior rarely performs worse than either source alone—  
a direct consequence of Bayesian shrinkage.

---

## 5.2 Nitrogen-use results {-}

Data-only OFPE decisions:

- often over-apply N when yield bumps occur by chance,  
- sometimes severely under-apply when local noise flattens the response.

Posterior recommendations:

- **moderate these swings**,  
- move N decisions toward more agronomically plausible rates,  
- reduce variance in N-use across years.

This makes posterior-based decisions both **economically efficient**  
and **operationally stable**.

---

# 6. Where Does OFPE Provide Meaningful Information? {-}

Posterior updates are largest when:

1. **OFPE replications are dense**,  
2. **curvature is consistent with APSIM structure**,  
3. **site-year weather strongly shifts the yield–N function**,  
4. **the OFPE field is agronomically different from its APSIM cell**.

Posterior updates are smallest when:

- OFPE cluster sizes are small,  
- the field-year is extremely noisy,  
- APSIM already closely matches realized yield levels.

Thus OFPE is most valuable when **fields deviate systematically from APSIM priors**,  
not when OFPE noise overwhelms field-specific signal.

---

# 7. Main Takeaways {-}

1. **OFPE alone is too noisy** to drive economically meaningful nitrogen recommendations.  
2. **APSIM alone lacks field specificity**, despite capturing correct biological structure.  
3. **The Bayesian posterior provides the correct balance**, incorporating:
   - structural agronomy from APSIM  
   - trial-based evidence from OFPE  
   - economic reasoning via expected profit maximization  

4. Posterior recommendations:
   - are stable across years,  
   - adapt to field-specific patterns,  
   - minimize regret relative to benchmark decisions.

This transforms OFPE from a forecasting tool into a **sequential field-specific learning system**, enabling farmers to refine nitrogen decisions over time.

---

# 8. Link to Limitations and Future Work {-}

The limitations of OFPE noise and APSIM structural bias suggest several next steps:

- hierarchical Bayesian structures linking years of data for the same field,  
- improved priors using county or CRD yield distributions,  
- integration of soil microbial and mineralization models,  
- uncertainty quantification over APSIM parameterization.

These will be addressed in the concluding chapter on limitations and extensions.
