## 1. Farmer’s Decision Problem under Uncertainty {-}

Farmers choose nitrogen (N) without knowing the true yield response function.  
Two empirical realities constrain that decision:

1. **OFPE experiments are highly noisy**  
   Spatial variability, year effects, and management heterogeneity produce  
   imprecise estimates of the yield–N curve from a single field-year trial  
   [@de2023predicting; @bullock2019data].

2. **APSIM provides mechanistic structure but lacks field specificity**  
   Process-based crop models such as APSIM capture biophysical N–water–growth
   dynamics across weather years [@holzworth2014apsim],  
   but they do not replicate field-level soil heterogeneity or yield levels.

Neither source alone delivers a reliable N recommendation.  
This motivates a **Bayesian learning structure**, in which:

- **APSIM** provides a prior belief about yield distributions, and  
- **OFPE** supplies noisy field-specific evidence that updates the prior.

### APSIM and OFPE as Complementary Information Sources {-}

Let $Y(N)$ be random yield at nitrogen rate $N$,  
and let $p_y$ and $p_n$ denote crop and nitrogen prices.

Profit is:

$$
\pi(N) = p_y Y(N) - p_n N.
$$

The farmer selects:

$$
N^\star = \arg\max_N \mathbb{E}[\pi(N)].
$$

The difficulty is that the expectation $\mathbb{E}[Y(N)]$ is unknown.  
A rational decision maker therefore operates with a *subjective predictive distribution* for $Y(N)$.


## 2. **APSIM: A Prior Distribution** {-}

APSIM generates a distribution for yield conditional on nitrogen:

$$
f_{\text{prior}}(y \mid N),
$$

with implied prior moments:

$$
\big\{ \mu_{1,0}(N),\ \mu_{2,0}(N),\ \mu_{3,0}(N) \big\}.
$$

This prior encodes:

- long-run climate variability,  
- soil × water × nitrogen dynamics,  
- agronomically plausible curvature and diminishing returns.

But APSIM alone cannot reflect:

- field-specific yield levels,  
- micro-scale soil variation,  
- management idiosyncrasies.

Thus it is an **informed prior**, not a prescriptive curve.

---

## 3. **OFPE: Noisy Field-Specific Evidence** {-}

One OFPE field-year produces sample moments at each rate $N$:

$$
\bar{Y}(N), \quad s^2(N), \quad m_3(N),
$$

but these reflect *one realization* of:

- weather,
- soil heterogeneity,
- field operations.

OFPE therefore provides **high-variance evidence** that cannot stand alone as an estimator of $Y(N)$.

---

## 4. Bayesian Updating: Constructing the Posterior Yield Distribution {-}

The farmer combines APSIM structure with OFPE evidence through:

$$
f_{\text{post}}(y \mid N)
\ \propto\
f_{\text{prior}}(y \mid N)
\times
L(\text{OFPE data} \mid y, N),
$$

where the likelihood is derived from OFPE sample moments.

### **Posterior mean** {-}

Under a normal–normal moment-matching structure:

$$
\mu_{1,\text{post}}(N)
=
\frac{\tau_0 \mu_{1,0}(N) + \tau_d \bar{Y}(N)}
     {\tau_0 + \tau_d},
$$

where:

- $\tau_0 = 1/\mu_{2,0}(N)$ is prior precision,  
- $\tau_d = 1/[s^2(N)/n(N)]$ is data precision.

This is classical Bayesian shrinkage:  
the posterior pulls noisy OFPE data toward the APSIM expectation,  
with the weight determined by the relative variances.

### **Posterior variance** {-}

$$
\mu_{2,\text{post}}(N)
=
\frac{1}{\tau_0 + \tau_d}.
$$

### **Posterior skewness (third moment)** {-}

OFPE rarely identifies skewness reliably from a single season.  
Thus the third moment is inherited from APSIM:

$$
\mu_{3,\text{post}}(N) = \mu_{3,0}(N).
$$

### **Posterior predictive distribution** {-}

Given the triple of posterior moments  
$(\mu_{1,\text{post}},\mu_{2,\text{post}},\mu_{3,\text{post}})$,  
we construct the **maximum-entropy density**:

$$
f_{\text{post}}(y \mid N)
\propto
\exp(\lambda_1 y + \lambda_2 y^2 + \lambda_3 y^3),
$$

solving for $\lambda$’s so that the posterior moments match  
[@jaynes1957information].

This provides a *full predictive distribution*, not only mean–variance.

## 5. Bayesian Optimal Nitrogen Rate {-}

Given the posterior density:

$$
N^\star_{\text{post}}
=
\arg\max_N
\Big\{
p_y \mu_{1,\text{post}}(N) - p_n N
\Big\}.
$$

Posterior expectations produce:

- smoother and more stable optimal N curves,  
- less sensitivity to OFPE noise,  
- more economically coherent recommendations.

This contrasts sharply with:

- **data-only EONR**, which is highly unstable, and  
- **APSIM-only EONR**, which ignores field-level evidence.

The key conceptual contribution is:

> **OFPE is not a stand-alone estimator but an updating mechanism that refines prior knowledge about a specific field.**
