# Preface

This bookdown project documents a prototype pipeline that connects:

- field-scale On-Farm Precision Experiment (OFPE) data,
- mechanistic crop simulation using APSIM,
- and Bayesian yield–nitrogen response estimation using APSIM-based priors.

The goal is **not** to provide a definitive, fully general solution. Instead, it:

- shows what is currently possible with the existing OFPE data,
- illustrates the limitations of purely data-driven tree-based models for yield prediction at new fields,
- and demonstrates how regional APSIM simulations can be used to construct prior yield–N distributions for Illinois, which are then updated using OFPE trials.

The main story is in Chapter 1 (Overview).  
Chapters 2–5 provide the technical details and reproducible code behind each figure.
