title: "Overview: Why APSIM-Based Priors for OFPE?"

# Overview

In this chapter I give a high-level overview of the project using seven figures:

1. The spatial distribution of all OFPE fields used in this study (ambiguous US map).
2. An example showing the limitations of tree-based ensemble models for yield prediction at a field with multiple years of trials.
3. Yield–N response curves for the same field, comparing ex-post "true" responses to machine learning forecasts.
4. The Illinois-only subset of fields used in the APSIM–Bayesian prototype.
5. APSIM-based prior yield–N distributions for representative Illinois soils under long-term historical weather.
6. A conceptual illustration of how OFPE data update APSIM priors.
7. An example posterior yield–N curve for an Illinois field after Bayesian updating.

Technical details, full code, and additional figures appear in later chapters.

# Figure 1: All OFPE fields (ambiguous US map)

This figure shows the approximate locations of all OFPE fields used in the project, 
displayed over a US state map. Exact coordinates are not shown; 
the goal is to convey the overall spatial footprint and the diversity
of agro-ecological contexts that motivated the original multi-field analysis.


# Figure 2: Limitations of tree ensembles for a multi-year field

Here we focus on a single farm–field with multiple years of OFPE trials.
The figure compares observed yield to predictions from a tree-based ensemble model
 (for example, random forest or XGBoost) trained on all other locations and evaluated 
 in a leave-one-location-out or leave-one-year-out fashion.

The key message is that, under the current data quantity and quality, purely data-driven
 models struggle to generalize yield predictions to new field-year conditions.


 # Figure 3: Yield–N response comparison (true vs ML forecasts)

 For the same field, we compare yield–N response curves:

an ex-post "true" yield–N curve derived from the observed strip-level trials, and

one or more forecast curves obtained by aggregating machine learning predictions across N rates.

This figure illustrates that even when we step back from point-level prediction and focus on yield–N curves, 
the ML models do not reliably recover the response with the current data.



# Figure 4: Illinois-only subset for the APSIM–Bayesian prototype

While the full OFPE dataset spans multiple states, the APSIM–Bayesian prototype in this project is restricted to Illinois field trials. Illinois provides a relatively coherent soil–weather region with a sufficient number of complete farm–field–year observations.

This figure highlights the Illinois fields used in the subsequent APSIM prior construction and Bayesian updating.


# Figure 5: APSIM-based Illinois prior yield–N distributions

Using representative Illinois soils (derived from SSURGO) and long-term historical weather (for example, Daymet-based .met files), APSIM is used to simulate yield for multiple N rates across many years.

For each soil–N combination, the resulting distribution of yields forms a prior yield–N distribution. This figure visualizes those priors, for example as ridge plots or bands showing quantiles across N rates.


# Figure 6: Conceptual illustration of prior updating with OFPE data

This figure is intentionally conceptual. It shows:

an APSIM-derived prior yield–N curve with uncertainty bands,

observed OFPE yield–N points for a given field, and

an updated posterior yield–N curve after Bayesian estimation.

The goal is to communicate the idea that OFPE data do not have to fully identify the yield–N response on their own; instead, they update a mechanistic prior informed by soil and long-term climate.


# Figure 7: Example posterior yield–N curve for an Illinois field

Finally, we show an empirical posterior yield–N curve for one Illinois field from the Bayesian model, along with the corresponding APSIM prior. This figure demonstrates that:

posterior curves are smoother and more stable than the ex-post field-only curve,

the APSIM prior provides structure in data-sparse regions of N,

and the model returns a distribution for the economically optimal N rate, rather than a single point.
